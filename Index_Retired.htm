            <h2>What is Cadet Link</h2>
            <p>The operation of cadets, like the army itself requires a certain amount of logistical support, 
            The difference is in Cadets we don’t have a whole Corp supporting us and although the efforts of 
            our CFAV’s (Cadet Force Adult Volunteer) keep the process mostly up to date, something sometimes 
            does still get forgotten or missed. <b>CadetLink</b> would be able to take a lot of the annoying tasks 
            out of the logistics of cadets. Information about trips, Orders for this week, what Kit to bring 
            (and whenever its short sleeves or not), scores for section competitions and a way for uniform issues 
            to be logged would all be displayed in an easy-to-use central display. Other features like talking 
            to an NCO could be implemented. Each cadet would have their own log in. the uniform issues would 
            be logged, cross referenced against the Quartermaster’s database and would have the option to be 
            displayed in an excel spread sheet. </p>
